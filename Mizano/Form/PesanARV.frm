 '   Hello My Name is Shoaib Mohammed and Iam Doin my I BE on Electrical & Electronics
'Engineering.This Small Program Show how to create a High Class Notification Box on The
'task bar as some programs do (example Norton Antivirus). It was Norton which inspired me
'create this. This is not fully error free and needs a lot of maintainance to produce
'a error free message.

'    You have to constantly monitor the message showed. U cannot show a message until
'a previous one  closes completely. other than that there would be no problem , i think.
'i created this program in a hurry ( i am getting late for the date....just kidding...have
'to hang out with friends and prepare for tommororws exam)and so i was no able to add any
'detailed comments.
    
'    The Best Part of this is that it does no use any api call ( Except to make the
'form transparent). It uses Pure VB and Mathematical calculation (easy to undr stand).


    'I think This woudld be much useful and would provide a Better Interface for ur'
'program.

 '   This is just a base class and u are free to change it any way as you like to
'your own style. U have the full permission of using this code or modifying it or using
'it in any commercial package(but please send ur comments that what keeps programmers
'like me on the GO.)


 '   PLEASE SEND IN UR COMMENTS OR BUGS TO
